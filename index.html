            <p>My passion for web development began in high school, when I took a course on computer science. I was fascinated by the idea of building something that could be accessed by anyone in the world with an internet connection. I started by building basic websites for my family and friends, and eventually started working on more complex projects. One of my favorite projects was building a website for a local charity organization. It was an amazing feeling to know that my work was helping others in my community. Since then, I have continued to develop my skills and collaborate with others to create great projects.</p>

<p>Outside of web development, I am also passionate about exploring the great outdoors through hiking and camping. I find that being in nature is a great way to recharge and gain perspective. Additionally, I enjoy reading books on history and philosophy. I am fascinated by the way that historical events and philosophical ideas have shaped our world and continue to influence our thinking today.</p>
